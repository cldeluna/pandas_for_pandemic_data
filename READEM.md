# Using Pandas to look at Pandemic Data


The script and supporting files in this repository are intended to show how the Python Pandas module can be used to analyze data, in particular COVID-19 data.

Im going to recommend 3 data sets to "investigate":

- [WHO](https://who.sprinklr.com/) (Download from 06 April 2020)
- [CSSEGISandData on GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData)
- [New York Times US Data GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
